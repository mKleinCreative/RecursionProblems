 * If the target value is less than the middle element's value, then the search
 * continues on the lower half of the array; or if the target value is greater
 * than the middle element's value, then the search continues on the upper half
 * of the array. This process continues, eliminating half of the elements,
 * and comparing the target value to the value of the middle element of the
 * remaining elements - until the target value is either found (and its associated
 * element position is returned), or until the entire array has been searched
 * (and "not found" is returned).
 * 
 * Write a recursive binary search: bsearch(array, target).
 * Note that binary search only works on sorted arrays.
 * Make sure to return the location of the found object (or null if not found!).
